These are notes from [Prof. Michael Kearns](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/)' CIS625. This course is currently being taught at the University of Pennsylvania and  attempts to provide algorithmic, complexity-theoretic and probabilistic foundations to modern machine learning and related topics. You can find out more at the [course website](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/COLT/). A word of caution, it is likely that some typos and/or errors have been introduced during the taking of these notes.
