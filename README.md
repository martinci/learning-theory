# Computational Learning Theory (Penn CIS625)

These are notes from [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/](Prof. Michael Kearns)'s CIS625. This course is currently being taught at the University of Pennsylvania and  attempts to provide algorithmic, complexity-theoretic and probabilistic foundations to modern machine learning and related topics. You can find out more at the [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/COLT/](course website). A word of caution, it is likely that some typos and/or errors have been introduced during the taking of these notes.
